## Use nullability in Kotlin
### What you'll learn
1. What null is.
2. The difference between nullable and non-nullable types.
3. What null safety is, its importance, and how Kotlin achieves null safety.
4. How to access methods and properties of nullable variables with the ?. safe call operator and !! non-null assertion operator.
5. How to perform null checks with if/else conditionals.
6. How to convert a nullable variable to a non-nullable type with if/else expressions.
7. How to provide a default value when a nullable variable is null with the if/else expression or the ?: Elvis operator.

## Use classes and objects in Kotlin
**Encapsulation**. Wraps the related properties and methods that perform action on those properties in a class. For example, consider your mobile phone. It encapsulates a camera, display, memory cards, and several other hardware and software components. You don't have to worry about how components are wired internally.

**Abstraction**. An extension to encapsulation. The idea is to hide the internal implementation logic as much as possible. For example, to take a photo with your mobile phone, all you need to do is open the camera app, point your phone to the scene that you want to capture, and click a button to capture the photo. You don't need to know how the camera app is built or how the camera hardware on your mobile phone actually works. In short, the internal mechanics of the camera app and how a mobile camera captures the photos are abstracted to let you perform the tasks that matter.

**Inheritance**. Enables you to build a class upon the characteristics and behavior of other classes by establishing a parent-child relationship. For example, there are different manufacturers who produce a variety of mobile devices that run Android OS, but the UI for each of the devices is different. In other words, the manufacturers inherit the Android OS feature and build their customizations on top of it.

**Polymorphism**. The word is an adaptation of the Greek root poly-, which means many, and -morphism, which means forms. Polymorphism is the ability to use different objects in a single, common way. For example, when you connect a Bluetooth speaker to your mobile phone, the phone only needs to know that there's a device that can play audio over Bluetooth. However, there are a variety of Bluetooth speakers that you can choose from and your phone doesn't need to know how to work with each of them specifically.
